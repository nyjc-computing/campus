# Campus Client Branch Progress

This document tracks the progress of multiple PRs within the campus-client branch.

## Session Summary

**Last session completed:** PR 1 - Specifying Base URLs (January 20, 2025)
**Next session starts with:** PR 2 - Module Organization
**Commit ready:** Yes - PR 1 implementation is complete and ready for commit

## Overview

The campus-client branch contains several improvements to the campus client system:
1. âœ… Specifying base URLs for different deployments (COMPLETE)
2. Module organization for scalability 
3. API alignment between client and server
4. Documentation improvements
5. Migration from campus.vault to campus.client

## PR 1: Specifying Base URLs

**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Configure manually specifiable base URLs for different deployments

### Current State
- campus.apps deployed at: `api.campus.nyjc.dev`
- campus.vault deployed at: `vault.campus.nyjc.dev`
- Both accessed through campus.client namespace
- Existing `campus/client/config.py` with hardcoded URLs
- Individual client classes override `_get_default_base_url()`

### Requirements
- Manual base URL specification per deployment
- No hardcoded deployment-specific URLs
- Flexible configuration for future deployment splits
- Backward compatibility with existing client initialization

### Analysis
Current implementation has:
1. `config.py` with hardcoded URLs and service mappings
2. Individual client classes with hardcoded `_get_default_base_url()` methods
3. BaseClient accepts `base_url` parameter but defaults to vault URL

### Solution Implemented
1. Modified `config.py` to support environment variable configuration
2. Added `get_service_base_url()` function for dynamic URL resolution
3. Updated client classes to use config-based URL resolution
4. Maintained backward compatibility with explicit base_url parameters
5. Created configuration documentation

### Files Modified
- [x] `campus/client/config.py` - Added environment variable support and service URL resolution
- [x] `campus/client/base.py` - Updated imports and base URL resolution logic  
- [x] `campus/client/circles.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `campus/client/users.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `campus/client/vault.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `docs/client-configuration.md` - Configuration documentation

### Environment Variables Added
- `CAMPUS_APPS_BASE_URL` - Base URL for apps services
- `CAMPUS_VAULT_BASE_URL` - Base URL for vault services

Ready for commit!

## PR 2: Module Organization

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Improve organization for many client resources

### Current State
- Flat file structure in `campus/client/`
- Individual files for each resource type

### Analysis Needed
- Review current structure
- Design scalable organization pattern
- Consider subresource grouping

---

## PR 3: API Alignment Check

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Document mismatches between client and server APIs

### Analysis Required
- Compare campus.client resource names vs campus.apps
- Compare campus.client paths vs campus.vault
- Document parameter mismatches
- **Note:** No implementation changes, documentation only

---

## PR 4: Documentation

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Create comprehensive documentation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Package README for campus.client
- [ ] Resource/subresource documentation
- [ ] Available verbs documentation
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` for campus.client

---

## PR 5: Refactor Migration

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Migrate from campus.vault model to campus.client

### Current Issues
- campus.storage relies on campus.vault
- campus.apps relies on campus.vault
- campus.models relies on campus.vault
- Requires VAULTDB_URI environment variable
- Security concerns with current implementation

### Analysis Required
- Identify all dependencies on campus.vault
- Plan migration strategy
- Assess security improvements
