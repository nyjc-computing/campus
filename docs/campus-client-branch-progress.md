# Campus Client & Subpackaging Progress

This document tracks the completion status of campus client improvements and remaining migration work.

## Current Status (July 21, 2025)

**Major subpackaging PR:** ✅ **MERGED** 
**Campus client improvements:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Remaining work:** Legacy dependency migration

## Completed Work

All campus-client branch improvements have been successfully merged:
1. ✅ Subpackaging architecture with individual `pyproject.toml` files
2. ✅ Campus.client module with service-based organization  
3. ✅ Base URL configuration via environment variables
4. ✅ API alignment documentation between client and server
5. ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Remaining Migration Work

### Legacy Dependencies to Address

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High - Required for clean subpackage architecture

#### Current Legacy Imports Found:
1. **campus/workspace/__init__.py**: `import campus.vault as vault`
2. **campus/apps/campusauth/context.py**: `from campus.vault.client import ClientResource`  
3. **Documentation**: References to old usage patterns

#### Migration Strategy:
- Replace direct `campus.vault` model imports with `campus.client` equivalents
- Update authentication contexts to use client-based vault access
- Remove VAULTDB_URI dependency where possible
- Update documentation for new patterns

#### Security Improvements:
- Client-based vault access (no direct DB connection needed)
- Proper authentication flows through campus.client
- Elimination of hardcoded database URIs in application code

## Architecture Overview

### Current Subpackage Structure
```
campus/
├── apps/         → campus-apps (web applications)
├── client/       → campus-client (HTTP client library)  
├── common/       → campus-common (shared utilities)
├── models/       → campus-models (data models)
├── storage/      → campus-storage (database abstractions)
├── vault/        → campus-vault (secrets management)
└── workspace/    → campus-workspace (development tools)
```

Each subpackage has its own `pyproject.toml` and can be installed independently.
