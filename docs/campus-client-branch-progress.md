# Campus Client Branch Progress

This document tracks the progress of multiple PRs within the campus-client branch.

## Session Summary

**Last session completed:** PR 2 - Module Organization (July 21, 2025)
**Next session starts with:** PR 3 - API Alignment Check
**Commit ready:** Yes - PR 2 implementation is complete and ready for commit

## Overview

The campus-client branch contains several improvements to the campus client system:
1. ✅ Specifying base URLs for different deployments (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ Module organization for scalability (COMPLETE)
3. API alignment between client and server
4. Documentation improvements
5. Migration from campus.vault to campus.client

## PR 1: Specifying Base URLs

**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Configure manually specifiable base URLs for different deployments

### Current State
- campus.apps deployed at: `api.campus.nyjc.dev`
- campus.vault deployed at: `vault.campus.nyjc.dev`
- Both accessed through campus.client namespace
- Existing `campus/client/config.py` with hardcoded URLs
- Individual client classes override `_get_default_base_url()`

### Requirements
- Manual base URL specification per deployment
- No hardcoded deployment-specific URLs
- Flexible configuration for future deployment splits
- Backward compatibility with existing client initialization

### Analysis
Current implementation has:
1. `config.py` with hardcoded URLs and service mappings
2. Individual client classes with hardcoded `_get_default_base_url()` methods
3. BaseClient accepts `base_url` parameter but defaults to vault URL

### Solution Implemented
1. Modified `config.py` to support environment variable configuration
2. Added `get_service_base_url()` function for dynamic URL resolution
3. Updated client classes to use config-based URL resolution
4. Maintained backward compatibility with explicit base_url parameters
5. Created configuration documentation

### Files Modified
- [x] `campus/client/config.py` - Added environment variable support and service URL resolution
- [x] `campus/client/base.py` - Updated imports and base URL resolution logic  
- [x] `campus/client/circles.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `campus/client/users.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `campus/client/vault.py` - Use config-based URLs
- [x] `docs/client-configuration.md` - Configuration documentation

### Environment Variables Added
- `CAMPUS_APPS_BASE_URL` - Base URL for apps services
- `CAMPUS_VAULT_BASE_URL` - Base URL for vault services

Ready for commit!

## PR 2: Module Organization

**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Improve organization for many client resources

### Requirements Achieved
- Service-based organization (apps vs vault)
- Hidden implementation details (no direct client instantiation)
- Clean module interfaces using sys.modules replacement pattern
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Scalable structure for future resources

### Implementation Details
1. **Service directories created:**
   - `campus/client/apps/` - Apps service modules (users, circles)
   - `campus/client/vault/` - Vault service modules (vault, access, client)

2. **Module pattern standardized:**
   - All modules use `sys.modules[__name__] = ModuleClass()` pattern
   - Users interact with module instances, not client classes
   - Clean interfaces: `users["user123"]`, `vault["apps"]`

3. **Import structure:**
   - Service-specific: `from campus.client.apps import users`
   - Convenience: `from campus.client import users`
   - Both patterns work and return the same module instances

### Files Created/Modified
- [x] `campus/client/apps/__init__.py` - Apps service exports
- [x] `campus/client/apps/users.py` - Moved and updated with module pattern
- [x] `campus/client/apps/circles.py` - Moved and converted to module pattern
- [x] `campus/client/vault/__init__.py` - Vault service exports  
- [x] `campus/client/vault/vault.py` - Moved and updated
- [x] `campus/client/vault/access.py` - Moved and modularized
- [x] `campus/client/vault/client.py` - Moved and modularized
- [x] `campus/client/__init__.py` - Updated for new organization
- [x] Removed old flat files: `users.py`, `circles.py`, `vault*.py`
- [x] **Updated all imports to use absolute imports** (from `..base` to `campus.client.base`)
- [x] **Fixed BaseClient HTTP methods** - Added `params` support to `_delete`, `_put`, `_post` for API consistency

### Validation
✅ Service imports work: `from campus.client.apps import users, circles`
✅ Vault imports work: `from campus.client.vault import vault`
✅ Convenience imports work: `from campus.client import users`
✅ Module replacement pattern works correctly
✅ No direct client class exposure

Ready for commit!

## PR 3: API Alignment Check

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Document mismatches between client and server APIs

### Analysis Required
- Compare campus.client resource names vs campus.apps
- Compare campus.client paths vs campus.vault
- Document parameter mismatches
- **Note:** No implementation changes, documentation only

---

## PR 4: Documentation

**Status:** Partially Complete
**Goal:** Create comprehensive documentation

### Deliverables
- [ ] Package README for campus.client
- [ ] Resource/subresource documentation
- [ ] Available verbs documentation
- [x] `pyproject.toml` for campus.client

### Completed Work
- Created `campus/client/pyproject.toml` following established subpackage pattern
- Package name: `campus-client`
- Minimal dependencies: only `requests` (no campus dependencies)
- Independent distribution ready
- Follows same structure as other subpackages (`campus-vault`, `campus-apps`, etc.)

### Configuration Details
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-client"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "HTTP client library for Campus vault and apps services"
packages = [{include = "campus/client", from = "../.."}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
requests = "^2.32.4"
```

This enables independent installation: `pip install campus-client` with no server dependencies.

## PR 5: Refactor Migration

**Status:** Not Started
**Goal:** Migrate from campus.vault model to campus.client

### Current Issues
- campus.storage relies on campus.vault
- campus.apps relies on campus.vault
- campus.models relies on campus.vault
- Requires VAULTDB_URI environment variable
- Security concerns with current implementation

### Analysis Required
- Identify all dependencies on campus.vault
- Plan migration strategy
- Assess security improvements

## Commit Strategy

Work will be kept atomic with clean commits for each logical unit of work.
Progress will be tracked and commits will be made when significant milestones are reached.
