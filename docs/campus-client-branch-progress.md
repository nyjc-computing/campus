# Campus Client & Subpackaging Progress

This document tracks the completion status of campus client improvements and remaining migration work.

## Current Status (July 21, 2025)

**Major subpackaging PR:** ✅ **MERGED** 
**Campus client improvements:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Remaining work:** Legacy dependency migration

## Completed Work

All campus-client branch improvements have been successfully merged:
1. ✅ Subpackaging architecture with individual `pyproject.toml` files
2. ✅ Campus.client module with service-based organization  
3. ✅ Base URL configuration via environment variables
4. ✅ API alignment documentation between client and server
5. ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Remaining Migration Work

### Legacy Dependencies to Address

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High - Required for clean subpackage architecture

#### Current Legacy Imports Found:
1. **campus/workspace/__init__.py**: `import campus.vault as vault`
2. **campus/apps/campusauth/context.py**: `from campus.vault.client import ClientResource`  
3. **Documentation**: References to old usage patterns

#### Migration Strategy:
- Replace direct `campus.vault` model imports with `campus.client` equivalents
- Update authentication contexts to use client-based vault access
- **Eliminate VAULTDB_URI dependency** - apps should not directly connect to vault database
- **Retrieve MongoDB URIs through vault client** instead of environment variables
- Update documentation for new patterns

#### Security Improvements:
- **No direct database connections** from application layers
- **Secrets managed centrally** through vault service HTTP API
- **Service-based authentication** flows through campus.client
- **Environment variables only for service discovery** (base URLs), not secrets

## Architecture Overview

### Current Subpackage Structure
```
campus/
├── apps/         → campus-apps (web applications)
├── client/       → campus-client (HTTP client library)  
├── common/       → campus-common (shared utilities)
├── models/       → campus-models (data models)
├── storage/      → campus-storage (database abstractions)
├── vault/        → campus-vault (secrets management)
└── workspace/    → campus-workspace (development tools)
```

Each subpackage has its own `pyproject.toml` and can be installed independently.

### Migration Testing Strategy

**Current Architecture Issue:**
The failing tests reveal that `campus.storage` and `campus.apps` currently make **direct database connections** via environment variables:
- `VAULTDB_URI` - Direct PostgreSQL access to vault database
- `MONGODB_URI` - Direct MongoDB access from storage layer

**Target Architecture:**
After migration, the application layers should:
- ✅ **No direct database access** from apps/storage
- ✅ **Secrets retrieved via HTTP** through `campus.client.vault`
- ✅ **Only service URLs in environment** (e.g., `CAMPUS_VAULT_BASE_URL`)
- ✅ **Database URIs managed centrally** by vault service

**Testing Approach:**
1. **Current State Testing**: Fix tests by providing required environment variables temporarily
2. **Migration Testing**: Verify equivalent functionality through vault client
3. **Final State Testing**: Ensure apps work without direct database environment variables

**Migration Test Suite Created:**
- ✅ `tests/test_migration_logic.py` - Tests migration logic without database dependencies
- ✅ `tests/migration_test_helpers.py` - Utilities and mocking helpers for different environments  
- ✅ `run_migration_tests.py` - Environment-aware test runner

**Current Test Status (Container Environment):**
```bash
🔍 Environment: container
   VAULTDB_URI: ❌
   MONGODB_URI: ❌

📊 Results: 5 tests
   Failures: 2 (expected - testing import dependencies)
   Errors: 0
✅ Test framework working correctly
```

**Next Steps:**
1. **Switch to codespace** with environment variables for full testing
2. **Run complete migration test suite** to validate current state
3. **Implement migration changes** with continuous testing
4. **Validate final state** ensures no database environment dependencies

**Test Coverage:**
- **Import pattern validation** - Tests client module structure and API
- **Mock-based testing** - Validates migration logic without real databases
- **Environment detection** - Adapts test suite to available resources
- **Error handling** - Validates consistent behavior between approaches
- **Migration pattern documentation** - Ensures transformation patterns are clear

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run migration tests (container environment)
python run_migration_tests.py

# In codespace with environment variables:
export VAULTDB_URI="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/vault"
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://user:pass@localhost/test_mongo"
python run_migration_tests.py  # Will run additional integration tests
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Application code never sees database credentials
- Centralized secret rotation through vault service  
- Clean separation between service discovery and secret management
