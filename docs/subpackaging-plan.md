# Subpackaging Implementation Plan

## Goal

Transform the Campus monorepo into a collection of independently distributable packages while maintaining the single-repository development experience.

## Dependency Architecture

### Circular Dependency Prevention

The vault service is designed to be completely independent to prevent circular dependencies:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│    apps     │──▶│   storage   │──▶│    vault    │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       │                  │                   │
       └──────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                          ▼
                   ┌─────────────┐
                   │   common    │
                   └─────────────┘
```

**Why vault must be independent:**
- Storage backends need database credentials from vault
- Apps need API keys and secrets from vault  
- Services need external service credentials from vault
- If vault depended on storage, it would create a circular dependency

**Vault's independence strategy:**
- Direct PostgreSQL connectivity via `psycopg2`
- Own connection management in `campus.vault.db`
- No dependency on `campus.storage` abstractions
- Only depends on `campus.common` for utilities

## Target Packages

### Priority 1: Core Infrastructure

#### 1. `campus-common`
**Purpose**: Shared utilities and foundational components
**Contents**: `campus/common/`
**Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies only

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-common"
description = "Shared utilities for Campus ecosystem"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    # Add minimal dependencies as needed
]
```

#### 2. `campus-vault`  
**Purpose**: Secure secrets management service
**Contents**: `campus/vault/`
**Dependencies**: `campus-common` **only** (no other campus packages to avoid circular dependencies)

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-vault"
description = "Secure vault service for managing secrets"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    "campus-common = { path = "../common", develop = true }"
    "psycopg2-binary = ^2.9.0"
    # NOTE: Cannot depend on campus-storage to avoid circular dependencies
    # Vault implements its own direct PostgreSQL access
]
```

#### 3. `campus-storage`
**Purpose**: Storage abstractions and backends  
**Contents**: `campus/storage/`
**Dependencies**: `campus-common`, `campus-vault` (for database secrets), database drivers

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-storage"
description = "Storage interfaces and backends for Campus"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    "campus-common = { path = "../common", develop = true }"
    "campus-vault = { path = "../vault", develop = true }"
    "psycopg2-binary = ^2.9.0"
    "pymongo = ^4.0.0"
]
```

#### 4. `campus-client`
**Purpose**: General-purpose client libraries for external integrations
**Contents**: `campus/client/`
**Dependencies**: `campus-common`, HTTP client libraries

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-client"
description = "Client libraries for external API integrations"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    "campus-common = { path = "../common", develop = true }"
    "requests = ^2.28.0"
]
```

#### 5. `campus-models`
**Purpose**: Data models and schemas
**Contents**: `campus/models/`
**Dependencies**: `campus-common`, validation libraries

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-models"
description = "Data models and schemas for Campus"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    "campus-common = { path = "../common", develop = true }"
]
```

#### 6. `campus-apps`
**Purpose**: Web applications and API endpoints
**Contents**: `campus/apps/`  
**Dependencies**: All other campus packages, Flask, web frameworks

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "campus-apps"
description = "Web applications and API for Campus"
dependencies = [
    "python = ^3.8"
    "campus-common = { path = "../common", develop = true }"
    "campus-vault = { path = "../vault", develop = true }"
    "campus-storage = { path = "../storage", develop = true }"
    "campus-client = { path = "../client", develop = true }"
    "campus-models = { path = "../models", develop = true }"
    "flask = ^2.0.0"
    "requests = ^2.28.0"
]
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Prerequisites (Completed ✅)

**Timeline**: Completed

1. **Namespace Structure Setup**
   - ✅ Created `campus/` namespace package
   - ✅ Moved all modules under `campus.*` namespace
   - ✅ Updated all imports to use new namespace structure

2. **Structure Cleanup**
   - ✅ Eliminated `campus.apps.common` to avoid confusion
   - ✅ Moved components directly to `campus.apps.*`
   - ✅ Simplified import paths

3. **Package Positioning**
   - ✅ Moved vault from `campus.services.vault` to `campus.vault`
   - ✅ Updated all references and documentation
   - ✅ Positioned vault as independent top-level package
   - ✅ Moved `campus.apps.client` to `campus.client`
     - **Reason**: The `client` module provides general-purpose classes and functions for interacting with APIs of integration providers. It is not application-specific and should be moved out of `campus.apps` to better align with its purpose.
   - ✅ Moved models from `campus.apps.models` to `campus.models`
     - **Reason**: Centralizing models in the root folder simplifies access and improves organization.
   - ✅ Updated all import statements to reflect the new model locations
   - ✅ Added re-exports in `campus/__init__.py` for static type checker compatibility

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Install all packages in development mode
poetry install

# Work on specific package
cd campus/vault
poetry install
poetry run pytest

# Run full application
poetry run python main.py
```

### Package Distribution
```bash
# Build individual package
cd campus/vault
poetry build

# Publish to PyPI
poetry publish
```

### External Usage
```bash
# Install just vault service
pip install campus-vault

# Use in external project
from campus.vault import get_vault
```

## Migration Strategy

### Import Compatibility
- All existing imports continue to work
- No code changes required during transition
- Gradual migration to package-specific installs

### Dependency Management
- Development: All packages installed together
- Production: Install only needed packages
- CI/CD: Test both scenarios

### Versioning Strategy
- Independent versioning per package
- Semantic versioning (semver)
- Coordinated releases for breaking changes

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Dependencies**: External projects only install what they need
2. **Faster Installation**: Smaller package sizes
3. **Independent Evolution**: Packages can evolve at different rates  
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between components
5. **Easier Testing**: Package-level isolation improves test reliability
6. **Better Documentation**: Package-specific docs for external users

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Dependency Hell
**Mitigation**: Careful dependency management, regular compatibility testing

### Risk: Development Complexity  
**Mitigation**: Maintain Poetry workspace for coordinated development

### Risk: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation**: Semantic versioning, coordinated releases, deprecation notices

### Risk: Build Pipeline Complexity
**Mitigation**: Incremental migration, shared CI/CD templates
