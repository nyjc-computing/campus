Campus Deployment Orchestrator

Entry point for deploying Campus services (vault or apps).
The campus.client library can be used independently to communicate with these deployments.

Deployment mode is determined by the content of the 'deploy' file:
- 'vault': Deploys the vault service only  
- 'apps': Deploys the full apps service

Clients use campus.client library to make HTTP requests to these deployed services.
