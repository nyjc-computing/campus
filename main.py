Campus Development Server

Development and testing entry point for Campus services.
For production deployment, use wsgi.py with Gunicorn or other WSGI servers.

Deployment mode is determined by the DEPLOY environment variable:
- DEPLOY=vault: Deploys the vault service only  
- DEPLOY=apps: Deploys the full apps service (default)

Usage:
    DEPLOY=vault python main.py     # Start vault development server
    DEPLOY=apps python main.py      # Start apps development server
    gunicorn wsgi:app               # Production deployment
