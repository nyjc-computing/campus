# campus-common

This package contains shared code and utilities for other Campus subpackages.

**Note:** This package is not intended to be installed directly by end users. It is used as a dependency by other installable subpackages (such as `client`, `vault`, `apps`, and `workspace`).

If you are looking to install Campus components, please use the `install.sh` script in one of the main subpackage directories (see the root README for details).
