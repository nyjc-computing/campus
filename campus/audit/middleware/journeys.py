Action-journey lifecycle (#828).

A journey groups every trace belonging to one user-initiated action
episode: the page load that began it, the XHRs and form posts it fires,
and the server-to-server calls those spawn (joined via SDK-forwarded
X-Journey-ID headers). This is distinct from *login* journeys (#803),
which correlate the browser hops of the login flow itself via the
campus_journey cookie.

Lifecycle:

- **Adopt** an inbound journey from the X-Journey-ID header (an
  SDK-forwarded child call, or an app that mints client-side) or the
  campus_action_journey cookie (same-origin XHRs/form posts/redirect
  GETs carry it automatically). A header-adopted journey may carry a
  human label in X-Journey-Name (#952), stashed for the span's
  tags.journey_name; cookie-adopted and minted journeys are unnamed.
- **Mint** a new journey on page navigations (Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
  or Accept: text/html) with no active journey — the navigation IS the
  user-initiated origin. Optional per registration: services with no
  browser surface (campus.api) or whose browser surface is the login
  flow itself (campus.auth, already covered by #803) register with
  ``mint_on_navigation=False`` and adopt only.
- **Continue** via the cookie: set/refreshed on every request that has
  an active journey, so a still-live cookie carries the episode across
  navigations too — deliberately, because a POST-redirect-GET result
  page cannot be distinguished from a fresh click, and splitting it
  would cut the action in half. Episodes stay action-sized through the
  sliding window instead: idle expiry (no request refreshes the cookie
  within ACTION_JOURNEY_COOKIE_MAX_AGE) ends the journey, and apps can
  mark hard boundaries with ``@journey(..., fresh=True)``. There is no
  explicit end state.

Trust stance matches X-Request-ID: journey ids are observability
correlation, not a security boundary — clients may forge them.
