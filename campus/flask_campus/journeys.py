"""campus.flask_campus.journeys

Action-journey decorator for client apps (#828).

One decorator is the entire API surface app authors touch:

    from campus import flask_campus

    @app.post("/assignments/submit")
    @flask_campus.journey("campus.submissions.submit")
    def submit_assignment(): ...

``@journey`` names the user action the view serves. Names follow the
yapper emission convention (``campus.<subject>[.<sub>].<action>``) and
reuse the same labels (#840): an emission is the event an episode
culminates in, so a journey named ``campus.submissions.submit`` reads
as "the episode that ended in that emission". Mint a new label (same
format) only when no emission exists for the action. The journey id
itself is adopted from the active request when one exists (the journeys
middleware's cookie/header adoption, or a previous hop of the same
episode) and minted fresh only when there is none — so decorating a
view is always safe, never fragments an ongoing episode, and requires
no knowledge of ids, cookies, or headers. ``fresh=True`` opts out of
adoption for a hard action boundary mid-episode.

Journeys are observability correlation, not application state: if audit
tracing is disabled the decorator still runs but nothing is recorded.
